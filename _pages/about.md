I‚Äôm Jin Zhou, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at George Mason University. My research bridges Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and immersive media system optimization.

In HCI, I investigate the ethical and psychological challenges of harassment in social VR and metaverse environments. One line of work focuses on the design of AI-driven detection systems, using Transformer models, behavioral modeling, and WebXR-based deployments to support fairness and safety. Another line addresses the psychological impact of harassment in immersive spaces, supported by large-scale surveys and user studies conducted within a custom-built interactive social VR platform developed in Unity and deployed on VR headsets.

In immersive media systems, I work on optimizing 360-degree video compression using spherical CNNs and autoencoders, and improving dynamic 3D scene representations such as NeRF and other 3D reconstruction models through model quantization, compression-aware training, and perceptual quality-preserving techniques. My work aims to balance transmission efficiency with visual fidelity, and has been published at venues like ACM Multimedia and IEEE VR.

My research interests also include <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>neural scene understanding</strong>, and <strong>human-centered AI</strong>. I focus on applying models such as <strong>transformers</strong>, <strong>autoencoders</strong>, and <strong>neural rendering frameworks</strong> to develop perceptually aware, efficient, and socially responsible technologies.

[Exploring Spherical Autoencoder for Spherical Video Content Processing](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10391202)

**Jin Zhou**, Na Li, Yao Liu, Shuochao Yao, Songqing Chen

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=cdj_IUEAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cdj_IUEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

- Proposed a **spherical CNN autoencoder framework** designed specifically for 360¬∞ video, addressing the geometric distortion challenges of spherical content.
- Introduced two key optimizations‚Äî**partial mesh processing** and **compressive sensing**‚Äîto improve encoding efficiency while significantly reducing computational cost and preserving perceptual quality.
- Achieved a **PSNR gain up to 40 dB**, outperforming standard 2D autoencoders by over **260%**, making the method well-suited for real-time immersive video streaming in VR/AR applications.
