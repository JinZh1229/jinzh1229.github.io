<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m Jin Zhou, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at George Mason University. Advised by **Dr.Songqing Chen**. My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the optimization of immersive multimedia systems, with a particular emphasis on ethical AI, user research, and efficient visual computing.

🧠 HCI & VR Ethics: Investigate harassment in social VR through AI-driven behavior detection and psychological analysis; conduct large-scale user studies in Unity-based immersive platforms.

🎥 3D Visual Computing & Compression: Enhance 360° video and dynamic 3D scene representation (e.g., NeRF, 360-degree video system) using autoencoder, quantization, perceptual modeling, and transmission-aware techniques.

🔍 Core Interests: Human-computer interaction, user research, understanding neural radiance fields, computer vision, and socially responsible AI systems.

[**Exploring Spherical Autoencoder for Spherical Video Content Processing**](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10391202)

**Jin Zhou**, Na Li, Yao Liu, Shuochao Yao, Songqing Chen

- Proposed a **spherical CNN autoencoder framework** designed specifically for 360° video, addressing the geometric distortion challenges of spherical content.
- Introduced two key optimizations—**partial mesh processing** and **compressive sensing**—to improve encoding efficiency while significantly reducing computational cost and preserving perceptual quality.
- Achieved a **PSNR gain up to 40 dB**, outperforming standard 2D autoencoders by over **260%**, making the method well-suited for real-time immersive video streaming in VR/AR applications.
