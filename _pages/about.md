I’m Shaofei Cai (蔡少斐 in Chinese, shaofei.cai@vipl.ict.ac.cn). I received my bachelor degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2019. Now I am a master's student in the Institue of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, under the directing of Liang Li since 2019. I’m interested in graph neural network, neural architecture search and neural-symbolic.
