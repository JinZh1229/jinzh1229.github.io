<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research interest lies in the field of data mining using complex network analysis and machine learning 
algorithms. I have an extensive publicationrecord , with more than 30 papers published in renowned international 
journals such as Physics Review, Nature Communications, Information Science, and Scientific Reports. These papers 
have been highly cited, with over 2500 citations counted by Google Scholar. Furthermore, I have served as a reviewer 
for prestigious journals. 

In terms of social services, I have recorded some popular science courses on big data and artificial intelligence. 
I have also conducted offline popular science training for students from multiple schools and participated in 
editing the first set of artificial intelligence teaching series in Chengdu.
