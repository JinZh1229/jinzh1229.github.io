I‚Äôm Jin Zhou, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at George Mason University. Advised by **Dr.Songqing Chen**. My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the optimization of immersive multimedia systems, with a particular emphasis on ethical AI, user research, and efficient visual computing.

üß† HCI & VR Ethics: Investigate harassment in social VR through AI-driven behavior detection and psychological analysis; conduct large-scale user studies in Unity-based immersive platforms.

üé• 3D Visual Computing & Compression: Enhance 360¬∞ video and dynamic 3D scene representation (e.g., NeRF, 360-degree video system) using autoencoder, quantization, perceptual modeling, and transmission-aware techniques.

üîç Core Interests: Human-computer interaction, user research, neural radiance fields understanding, computer vision, and socially responsible AI systems.

[Exploring Spherical Autoencoder for Spherical Video Content Processing](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10391202)

**Jin Zhou**, Na Li, Yao Liu, Shuochao Yao, Songqing Chen

- Proposed a **spherical CNN autoencoder framework** designed specifically for 360¬∞ video, addressing the geometric distortion challenges of spherical content.
- Introduced two key optimizations‚Äî**partial mesh processing** and **compressive sensing**‚Äîto improve encoding efficiency while significantly reducing computational cost and preserving perceptual quality.
- Achieved a **PSNR gain up to 40 dB**, outperforming standard 2D autoencoders by over **260%**, making the method well-suited for real-time immersive video streaming in VR/AR applications.

[**Dynamic 6‚ÄëDoF Volumetric Video Generation: Software Toolkit and Dataset**](https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP61759.2024.10743552)  

**Mufeng Zhu**, Yuan‚ÄëChun Sun, Na Li, **Jin Zhou**, Songqing Chen, Cheng‚ÄëHsin Hsu, Yao Liu  

- Released a **Blender-Python toolkit** to generate dynamic 6-DoF volumetric datasets from synthetic 3D assets, compatible with both point-cloud and NeRF-based representations.  
- Constructed a **comprehensive dataset**, including point-cloud sequences and training/testing splits, facilitating fair comparisons across volumetric video models.  
- Enabled multimedia systems research by delivering an **open-source toolkit and compliant dataset** under asset permissions, supporting benchmarking for practical volumetric streaming :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
