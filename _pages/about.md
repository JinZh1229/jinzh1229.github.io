<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I love the research career and would love to combine deep learning with smart hardware to serve human social work.  I always seek to adhere to long-termism, both to do meaningful research and live well! I am very willing to make like-minded friends and solve problems in research and life together!

My research interest includes rotating target detection, target detection in complex backgrounds, image recovery and reconstruction .
