I am a PHD student in [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk//) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I received my master degree in [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn//) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Fan Yu and [Prof. Xi Zhang](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhangxi.html//)in 2020. I received my B.Eng. degree in [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://meccol.dhu.edu.cn//) at Donghua University in 2017.

My research interest includes building control and autonomous vehicles. I have published 5 papers at the top international conferences and journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LWC2XQEAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LWC2XQEAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
